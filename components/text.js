          Hello Scout friends, Jane Street recruiters, and everyone else who
          stumbled upon this site! I'm Christopher Kei, a rising fourth-year
          computer science and mathematics major with a minor in computational
          data analytics at Northeastern University.

          I know this probably isn't what you expected so I'll try to keep this
          short. Unfortunately for the past few months, I've fallen into a daily
          routine that I would describe as "overly comfortable" and looks
          roughly like this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            7:55 am - wake up and eat a bowl of oatmeal with a single banana, a
            scoop of peanut butter, and a few taps of cinnamnon (ideally also
            add blueberries and granola)
          </li>
          <li>
            8:40 am - walk to Back Bay for co-op and make myself the first of
            three cups of coffee (dark roast with a splash of almond beverage)
          </li>
          <li>
            12:00 pm - eat a small lunch while playing chess with coworkers (
            <a href='https://www.chess.com/member/chriske1' target='_blank'>
              chriske1 on chess.com
            </a>
            , challenge me to a daily!)
          </li>
          <li>
            4:30 pm - pop open my fourth can of grapefruit bubly and a chocolate
            sea salt RXBAR (I tell myself it's for the protein)
          </li>
          <li>
            5:30 pm - walk back home towards Fenway Park to workout and prep
            dinner between sets (plus a run across the Charles, weather
            permitting)
          </li>
          <li>
            7:30 pm - shower to Spotify's "Unplugged" acoustic pop hits (while
            singing 50% of the lyrics correctly)
          </li>
          <li>
            7:45 pm - eat dinner, usually consisting of whichever meat was on
            sale that week and some leafy green vegetables stir fried with
            oyster sauce all served over brown rice (strong emphasis on the
            brown rice)
          </li>
          <li>
            8:30 pm - play "Rocket League" with my best friend, jam out on the
            piano, or read some classics ("The Grapes of Wrath" is truly a
            must-read)
          </li>
          <li>
            10:20 pm - tuck myself in bed and watch an episode of "Vincenzo"
            (easily one of my top three kdramas of all time in terms of
            cleverness)
          </li>
          <li>
            11:30 pm - sleep to the increasingly soothing sounds of cars driving
            along the Mass Pike (I'm teaching myself to be less sensitive to
            noise when trying to fall asleep)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have found this schedule to be extremely effective in the sense that
          it checks off all of my basic daily needs to grow as a person,
          including but not limited to intellectual pursuit, physical strength,
          and mental wellbeing. One large, very presently apparent downside,
          however, is that I often don't make time for side projects anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, I decided to make this temporary personal website. I'd
          like to warn you that the following might begin to get a bit
          unorderly, which, side note, I grew somewhat partial to such writing
          after reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", but you may ask,
          why spend so much time on such a useless, unheard of "temporary"
          personal website?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, for one, taking the time to build this site disrupted my typical
          schedule which was an extremely necessary first step. If I'm going to
          start regularly working on side projects again, I definitely have to
          break my psychological need to watch 70 minutes of K-dramas each
          night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, at this moment, I'm not ready to build my "permanent" personal
          website. When I start a project, I like to have a relatively
          comprehensive plan laid out, sometimes going as deep as how specific
          API queries will interact with one another. Even if those plans
          change, as they often do, I feel much more comfortable beginning my
          work knowing that I have some direction that I'm building towards.
          However, for my personal website, I have no idea what I want the
          design to be based off of. All I know right now is that my personal
          website is going to be a grand piece of art in the sense that it will
          be literally awesome, extremely unique, and a piece of work that makes
          me proud. Until I figure out what design exactly will accomplish those
          three goals, I'll be constantly thinking, but I won't be physically
          working on my personal website.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, but most honestly, I decided to touch up my resume and
          felt like it was lacking ðŸ˜…

        <p>
          If you've made it this far, thanks for listening to my monologue! I
          hope that you got a glimpse into my life that you wouldn't have seen
          otherwise, and I sure hope you didn't hate it. I'll definitely have a
          cleaner, more thorough introduction in my future, "permanent" personal
          website, but for now, check out some of the other cool websites I've
          worked on in the past and ways you can contact me below!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href='https://www.getcertainly.com/' target='_blank'>
              Certainly
            </a>{' '}
            - try to get an auto insurance quote! (you're gonna need an Illinois
            zip code)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='http://sevenpm.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>
              7pm
            </a>{' '}
            - my first full-stack side project that helps you discover
            restaurants (has actually come in handy a few nights)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='https://picassowl.web.app/' target='_blank'>
              Picassowl
            </a>{' '}
            - an attempt at learning Vue, Firebase, and image manipulation (has
            never come in handy)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='https://worksense.netlify.app/' target='_blank'>
              Worksense
            </a>{' '}
            - styled components and keyframe animations are pretty hype (along
            with workplace equality!)
          </li>
          <li>
            (516)434-8766 - really hoping no spam callers find this (does anyone
            else lookup area codes of new numbers?)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='mailto:kei.c@northeastern.edu'>kei.c@northeastern.edu</a> -
            definitely a better way to reach me than phone (why do people even
            keep phone numbers on resumes?)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href='https://github.com/chriskei' target='_blank'>
              Github
            </a>{' '}
            - I may very soon start working on an app that will hopefully cause
            a big splash in the restaurant scene (currently brainstorming names
            that can become as iconic as "Yelp", contact me if you have ideas!)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Stay safe,<br></br>Chris
